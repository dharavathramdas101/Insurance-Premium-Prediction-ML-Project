![image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*kXLixIx8LXvLJUUc07bBeg.jpeg)

The amount of the premium for a health insurance policy depends from person to person, as many factors affect the amount of the premium for a health insurance policy. Let’s say age, a young person is very less likely to have major health problems compared to an older person. Thus, treating an older person will be expensive compared to a young one. That is why an older person is required to pay a high premium compared to a young person.

Just like age, many other factors affect the premium for a health insurance policy. Hope you now have understood what health insurance is and how the premium for a health insurance policy is determined. In the section below, I will take you through the task of health insurance premium prediction with machine learning using Python.

## Health Insurance Premium Prediction using Python
The dataset that I am using for the task of health insurance premium prediction is collected from Kaggle. It contains data about:

• Medical Charges: Total medical expense charged to the plan for the calendar year

• Age: Insurance contractor’s age, ranging from 18 to 64

• Sex: Insurance contractor’s gender, Male or Female

• BMI (Body Mass Index) = Body Mass Index, Weight(Kg)/( Height(m)² )

• Children: Number of children covered by the plan/ Number of dependants

• Region: The beneficiary’s residential area in the US. Northeast, Southeast, Northwest, Southwest

• Smoker: Whether the insurance contractor is a smoker or not, Yes or No

As mentioned, medical charges will be our dependent variable and the rest will be our independent variables.



### Step 1 - Install the requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2 - Run main.py file

```bash
python main.py
```
